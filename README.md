# bombei

Self-updating panel to sync with [agScripts](https://github.com/Inventsable/agScripts) content.

The idea of this panel is to merge several of my previous ideas and implementations:

- Create your own menu - A customizable toolbar allowing the user to run scripts and other code with the ability to change order, behavior or visual assets (similar to KBar)
- bombei - The scripting platform for user-generated scripts and content
- brutalism - Taking notes from `<panelify>` component and other utilities that grabbed content from a remote source

This will solely be for Alphagraphics and to help our designers like Chris, Erick and Caesar with workflow tools. Since they have varying script experience and use, it's best to just have them install the panel once and have new content be inherited by the panel each time it mounts. Ideally once this is in prototyping stage, all work then shifts over to agScripts, and bombei will just serve as a middleman / docker.
